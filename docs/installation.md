### Installation Time Estimate

- **Initial Setup**: Approximately 2-3 hours, depending on system configuration and network conditions.
- **Upgrade/Repair**: Approximately 1-2 hours.

---

## System Requirements

- **PowerShell**: Version 5.1 or higher
- **Azure CLI**: Version 2.30.0 or higher

---

## Pre-Installation Checklist

- [ ] **Permissions**: Verify that you have one of the following roles on the VM/PC on which the installation will be ran:
    - MS Windows Administrator
    - Member of MS Windows Local Administrators

    This is required to install the product binaries to the Program Files(x86) directory

- [ ] **Azure Subscription Access**: Verify that you have one of the following role sets in the target Azure subscription:
    - Contributor **and** User Access Administrator roles
    - Owner role
- [ ] **Azure Quotas**: Ensure sufficient quotas for services like Compute, Storage, Cosmos DB, and OpenAI.
- [ ] **Dependencies Installed**:
    - [ ] PowerShell modules
    - [ ] Azure CLI and necessary extensions
- [ ] **Disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration**: Required for PowerShell scripts interacting with MS Graph API.
- [ ] **Azure Resource Provider Registration**: Each Azure service requires its corresponding resource provider to be registered at the subscription level before you can create or manage resources of that type. If you have previously used a service in the target Azure subscription, the Resource Provider is likely already registered. If they are not registered, you may encounter errors when trying to deploy resources.

## Terraform Installation Method

### Can I use Terraform to install GPT-X instead of PowerShell and the CLI?

Yes, you can use **Terraform** to install GPT-X, but we recommend starting with the supported installation method in a development/test sandbox environment. This will help you understand the necessary Azure resources and configurations before deploying them with Terraform.

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Sandbox Installation**:  
   Begin by performing the standard installation in a development or test sandbox environment using our **PowerShell and Azure CLI** method. This process automatically sets up and configures all necessary Azure resources.
   
2. **Testing and Validation**:  
   After the sandbox installation is complete, test the system to ensure that all components and applications are functioning as expected. This step also helps you observe the resource configurations that have been applied.
   
3. **Terraform Configuration**:  
   Once the sandbox environment is working, you can replicate the setup using Terraform for other environments like QA or Production. Inspect the resources created in the sandbox and use those configurations as a basis for writing your Terraform scripts.
   
    _Example Terraform Resource Block_
    ```hcl
    resource "azurerm_resource_group" "gptx" {
      name     = "GPTX-ResourceGroup"
      location = "East US"
    }

    resource "azurerm_storage_account" "gptx_store" {
      name                     = "gptxstore123456"
      resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.gptx.name
      location                 = azurerm_resource_group.gptx.location
      account_tier             = "Standard"
      account_replication_type = "LRS"
    }
    ```

4. **Resource Management**:
    During installation, you can choose to select existing Azure resources if applicable. This provides flexibility in managing and deploying resources across multiple environments.

By following this method, you can ensure that all required resources are correctly configured and tested before deploying GPT-X using Terraform in critical environments.

## Uninstallation and Rollback Procedures

### Uninstallation Process

1. **Run Uninstall Script**:
    - Use the provided uninstallation script to remove GPT-X resources.
2. **Manual Cleanup**:
    - Verify that all resources have been deleted from the Azure Portal.
    - Remove any residual files from the local machine.

### Rollback

1. **Backup Restoration**:
    - Restore configurations and data from backups taken prior to installation.
2. **Version Rollback**:
    - If downgrading, follow the installation steps for the previous version using the backup Installation ID and Key Vault.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors and Fixes

- **Script Execution Disabled**:
    - **Error**: `iHealthSetup.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`
    - **Solution**: Adjust PowerShell execution policies as described in the Pre-Installation Setup.

- **Insufficient Permissions**:
    - **Solution**: Ensure that you have the required Azure and local administrative permissions.

- **Quota Limits Reached**:
    - **Solution**: Check Azure subscription quotas and request increases if necessary.

### Log File Location
