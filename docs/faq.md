## Installation

### 7. Can I use Terraform to install GPT-X instead of PowerShell and the CLI?

Yes, you can use Terraform to install GPT-X, but the recommended approach is to first use our supported installation method in a **development/test sandbox environment**. This initial installation will create and configure all necessary Azure resources automatically. Hereâ€™s how the process works:

1. **Sandbox Installation**: In the development/test sandbox, our installation will set up the required Azure resources and configure them properly. This step ensures that everything works as expected and gives you visibility into what resources are created and which options are applied.

2. **Testing**: After the resources are created, you can test the system to confirm that all components and applications function as intended. This also allows your team to observe and understand the resource configurations.

3. **Terraform Configuration**: Once the sandbox environment is set up and tested, you can replicate the resource setup using Terraform. You can inspect the resources created in the sandbox and use that as a basis for your Terraform configurations when deploying GPT-X to QA or Production environments.

4. **Resource Management**: Our installations also support the option to select **existing Azure resources** during the installation process. This gives you flexibility in managing your resources between environments.

By following this approach, you ensure that all required resources are identified and tested before rolling out GPT-X to critical environments using Terraform.
