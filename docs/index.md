## Introduction

GPT-X is an advanced AI-powered solution designed to enhance business processes and decision-making by integrating cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) capabilities with enterprise data sources. The solution is built on the Azure Platform, leveraging the Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Search, and other Azure cloud services to provide real-time insights, automate workflows, and streamline operations across an enterprise.

## Key Features

- **Generative AI**: GPT-X leverages the Azure OpenAI Service to securely inference your private instances of Large Language Models (LLM) such as GPT-4o/4o-mini. By utilizing the Azure OpenAI Service in tandem with Azure AI Search, GPT-X has performant Retrieval Augemented Generation (RAG) pipelines, allowing users to utilize LLMs with context into your business data.   
- **Customizable Plans**: Organize and execute custom plans that allow users to query data sources, generate insights, and automate workflows tailored to specific business needs.
- **Enterprise-Grade Scalability**: Built on Azure infrastructure, GPT-X scales effortlessly to meet the needs of enterprises, offering flexibility, security, and performance.
- **Cross-System Integration**: Seamlessly connects with external systems like Epic, Availity, and other business applications to unify data, automate tasks, and provide comprehensive insights.

## Architecture

GPT-Xâ€™s architecture is built on Azure cloud services, ensuring high availability, security, and scalability. The key components include:

- **Azure App Service (ChatGPT-X)**: Web application deployed for user interaction (including Teams integration)
- **Azure Function (GPT Orchestrator)**: Manages the execution of plans and prompts, coordinating between various services like OpenAI, Cosmos DB, and external business applications.
- **Azure OpenAI Service**: Deploy and manage OpenAI models such as GPT-4o/4o-mini for handling advanced natural language processing tasks such as content generation, summarization, extraction, and automation, all within the secure and scalable Azure cloud environment.
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Stores and manages structured data, including Plans, prompts, user interactions, and external system data.

## Use Cases

### 1. Document Interrogation
Generate insights from complex documents by setting up a "document interrogation" Plan that queries various aspects of the document. GPT-X allows users to execute multiple prompts in parallel, extracting key information in real-time.

### 2. Claims Processing in Healthcare
Integrate with systems like Epic and Availity to match patient data with claims information, streamlining healthcare operations and improving claims accuracy by matching records between disparate systems.

### 3. Custom Reports & Automation
GPT-X enables users to create custom reports or automate workflows by setting up unique Plans that pull data from internal and external sources, process the data, and present actionable insights.
